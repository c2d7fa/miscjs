# Misc.js

[![NPM version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@johv/miscjs)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@johv/miscjs)

This is just a small library with various utility functions that I use for some of my personal projects, such as [Thinktool](https://github.com/c2d7fa/thinktool).

See the source code in `src/index.ts` for API and documentation.
